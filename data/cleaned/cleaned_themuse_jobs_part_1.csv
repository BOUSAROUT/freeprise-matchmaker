<p>- Utilize sales engagement, market research, and competitive intelligence to dominate the product area market.</p>

<p>- Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define and execute effective go-to-market strategies.</p>

<ol>
<li>Inform Product Strategy:</li>
</ol>

<p>- Partner with the product management team to strategize and launch new products, ensuring ongoing adoption.</p>

<p>- Develop a deep understanding of buyer behaviors, criteria, and influencers to inform product strategies</p>

<ol>
<li>Product Adoption and Success:</li>
</ol>

<p>- Understand the product's value proposition and competition, coaching teams on outmaneuvering rivals.</p>

<p>- Work closely with the demand generation team to develop impactful campaigns driving pipeline growth.</p>

<p>- Collaborate with the content marketing team to produce compelling materials such as solution briefs, white papers, blogs, videos, and third-party articles.</p>

For non-sales roles the hiring ranges reflect base salary only; employees are also eligible to receive annual bonuses. Hiring ranges for sales positions include base and incentive compensation target. Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.<br> <br>U.S. employees have <a href=""https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/careers/we-are-cisco/benefits-and-perks.html"">access</a> to quality medical, dental and vision insurance, a 401(k) plan with a Cisco matching contribution, short and long-term disability coverage, basic life insurance and numerous wellbeing offerings.

Employees accrue up to 20 days of Paid Time Off (PTO) each year and have access to paid time away to deal with critical or emergency issues without tapping into their PTO. We offer additional paid time to volunteer and give back to the community. Employees are also able to purchase company stock through our Employee Stock Purchase Program.<br> <br>Employees on sales plans earn performance-based incentive pay on top of their base salary, which is split between quota and non-quota components. For quota-based incentive pay, Cisco pays at the standard rate of 1% of incentive target for each 1% revenue attainment against the quota up to 100%. Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid.</p>",11799,ciscomeraki,https://www.themuse.com/jobs/ciscomeraki/technical-consulting-engineer-securityfirewallvpn-with-troubleshooting
