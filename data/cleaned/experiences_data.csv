Desta vez, para produzir o “Fest Band – Amplificando a Cena”, que tem em seu cerne, o objetivo de estar a serviço do fomento da cena musical local, colaborando para que a classe artística se reestabeleça depois do arrasador ano de 2020.A programação prevê ações que mitiguem os impactos da Covid-19 no setor musical local. Para isso, propõe atividades que remunerem (e arrecadem mais recursos) para o maior número possível de profissionais da cena musical que já passaram pelo festival. A proposta é uma edição histórica, com as 24 bandas (99 músicos) da região que mais se destacaram nas últimas duas edições (essas que marcaram a retomada do festival), além de técnicos, produtores e demais profissionais envolvidos (que somarão, ao menos 40 pessoas).",Feb 2021 Mar 2021 2 months,2 months,Mar 2021,Feb 2021,Festband - Amplificando a cena,Videomaker

As the API and apps economy continues to evolve, a design problem arises for API designers when internal systems are too complex to expose directly to app developers. The goal of an API Facade Pattern is to articulate those internal systems and make them useful and consumable by app developers. I used APIGEE to create api facade. Sometimes I had to work with different technologies to plan and to understand how to integrate the systems. In APIGEE (backendside), often I used Java and javascript to manage the requests/responses from/to clients. Clients were mobile apps (iOS or Android). I helped the frontend developers to reach the backend interfaces. Sometimes, I created Android prototypes to facilitate the frontend tasks and to allow a better understanding of the interfaces of the backend. My last task was the integration of OAuth2 in a mobile app using of three IDPs (Google, Facebook and SinaWeibo) and an account manager (CloudMinder).",Feb 2014 Dec 2018 4 years 11 months,4 years 11 months,Dec 2018,Feb 2014,MOBGEN | Accenture Interactive,System Integrator

tony-van-de-kasteele-6150a933,Brownies&downieS,brownies&downies,Hospitality,"Zwolle Area, Netherlands",https://www.linkedin.com/company/brownies&downies,"Brownies&downieS is een bijzonder lunchcafé opgericht door Thijs Swinkels en Teun Horck. Na maanden van voorbereiding werd in 2010 de eerste vestiging van Brownies&downieS in Veghel geopend. De combinatie van kwalitatief goede gerechten in combinatie met de unieke service van de bijzondere medewerkers zorgde voor een nieuw uniek horeca concept. Dit concept bleek dan ook direct een doorslaand succes ondanks de zware tijden in de horeca. In de loop van 2011 ontstond daarom het idee om een tweede vestiging in de directe omgeving te openen. Dit idee werd verder uitgewerkt en zo werd in 2012 de tweede vestiging in Sint-Oedenrode geopend. Op dat moment waren er geen verdere groeiplannen en werd de focus door Thijs en Teun gelegd op de twee vestigingen. Dit veranderde toen Sander van Brussel in 2012 aanklopte bij Thijs en Teun met de vraag of hij een eigen vestiging kon openen. Vanuit deze vraag werd in 2012 besloten een franchiseformule te schrijven. Vanaf dat moment ging het hard, en werden verschillende vestigingen door franchisenemers geopend. Op moment van schrijven telt Brownies&downieS 40 vestigingen. Brownies&downieS heeft de doelstelling om in 2020 87 vestigingen te hebben verdeeld over heel Nederland en België. Door onze interesse in het concept zijn Rutger Kanis en ik in maart 2016 in contact gekomen met Brownies&downieS. Wat begon met een idee is werkelijkheid geworden, wij zijn een eigen vestiging in Zwolle begonnen!",Sep 2016 - Present 5 years 8 months,5 years 8 months,Present,Sep 2016,Brownies&downieS,Eigenaar vestiging Zwolle
